### File scavenger hunt

You have 10 minutes to get to know this new Hugo site.

How? Meet my here bot! :mag:

Try to use the here bot messages to find the content file that produces the content in this starter site. There are:

-   3 blog posts
-   3 projects
-   3 talks

There are also 3 kinds of “layouts”:

-   Single
-   Single sidebar
-   Single series

See if you can spot all of these! Think of it like an easter egg hunt :egg:
